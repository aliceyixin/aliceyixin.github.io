  Abstract:
  Following the first release of ATLAS Open Data with a center of mass energy √s=8 TeV, ATLAS Open Data Group is going to release the second set of data and tools which produced by proton–proton collision in LHC with centre-of-mass energy √s=13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector during the year 2016. The ATLAS Open Data project aims to benefit the non-CERN members for teaching, outreach and science communication, as well as scientific research. The intended target audience is from high-school students upwards. There has been a previous release of 8 TeV ATLAS Open Data, which succeeded in making particle physics more accessible. The purpose of this work is to improve and build upon the first ATLAS Open Data release, by allowing users to study higher energy 13 TeV collisions. Associated computing tools are provided to make the analysis of the dataset easily accessible. The general aim of the dataset and tools released is to provide user-friendly and straightforward interactive interfaces to replicate the procedures used by high-energy physics researchers and enable users to experience the analysis of particle physics data in educational environments like university courses or as an extension of the International Particle Physics Masterclasses. This report first summarises the properties of the ATLAS Open Data 13 TeV dataset and the analysis tools. In addition, my summer project focuses on the development of interactive physics analysis tools based on ROOT framework and Jupyter notebooks. Integration of the ROOT data analysis framework with the Jupyter Notebook technology presents the potential of enhancement and expansion of educational and training programs. Two types of notebooks are developed in our work: some analysis examples and the analysis framework interface. The generated analysis structure and tutorials will be used to extend the participation of students from other locations around the World.
